### ðŸ¦  COVID-19 Data Analysis using Power BI
# ðŸ“Œ Objective
        The goal of this project is to analyze global COVID-19 data using Power BI and create an interactive dashboard that helps users understand trends in confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries over time and across countries.
# ðŸ“‚ Data Source
      - **Dataset:** [COVID-19 Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
      - The dataset includes daily COVID-19 statistics (confirmed, deaths, recoveries) for multiple countries worldwide.
# ðŸ§¹ Data Preparation
      - Cleaned null and missing values.
      - Formatted date columns and standardized country names.
      - Aggregated data for time-series analysis (daily and weekly trends).
# ðŸ“Š Power BI Dashboard Design
